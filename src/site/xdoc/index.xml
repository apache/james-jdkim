			<p>
				jDKIM is a DKIM implementation library written in Java.
				It provides both verification and signing and also
				provides Mailets for the Apache JAMES project.
			</p>

			<p>
				The 0.2 release is the first release. It requires Java
				1.4 at runtime but for full compliance with the DKIM
				specification the JVM running the library must support
				SHA256withRSA cypher suite. The default Sun Java 1.4
				does not support this suite, so either you move to Java
				1.5+ or you install a third party cryptography provider
				like BouncyCastle and configure it appropriately in your
				JVM.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Please make sure you use dnsjava <strong>2.0.7 or greater</strong>
				as 2.0.6 and previous versions don't handle correctly some TXT 
				record escaping that are very common in DKIM public key records.
				Failure to include such an updated dnsjava will prevent jDKIM
				from correctly verify signatures.
			</p>

			<p>
				The product currently include a generic library module
				called "main" and a module providing mailets for DKIM
				signing
